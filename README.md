# Data Mining & Analytics Experiments

This repository contains code and documentation for various experiments related to data mining and analytics. Each experiment focuses on different aspects of data processing, analysis, visualization, and mining techniques.

## Experiment 1: Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

In this experiment, we explore measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, quartiles) for numerical data. We calculate these statistics to understand the distribution and spread of the data.

## Experiment 2: Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Using Matplotlib, we visualize the data to gain insights and identify patterns. We create various types of plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and line plots to visualize the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Experiment 3: Data Preparation using NumPy and Pandas

In this experiment, we collect data from a specific source (e.g., CSV file, API, database) and inspect its structure. We use NumPy and Pandas to prepare the data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and manipulating it as needed.

## Experiment 4: Data Pre-processing with Pandas

We identify missing values in the dataset and choose appropriate methods for handling them, such as removal or imputation. Additionally, we remove duplicate records from the dataset and assess the impact on data quality.

## Experiment 5: Handling Categorical Data: One-Hot Encoding

Using Pandas, we implement one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a format suitable for modeling. This technique is commonly used in machine learning algorithms to handle categorical data.

## Experiment 6: Implement Association Rule Mining

In this experiment, we implement association rule mining techniques such as Apriori or FP-growth to discover interesting patterns or relationships in the data. This can be useful for market basket analysis or recommendation systems.

## Experiment 7: Design Interactive Dashboard using Tableau

Using Tableau, we design an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore the data in an intuitive and user-friendly way. This allows stakeholders to interactively analyze the data and gain insights.

## Experiment 8: Design Interactive Dashboard using PowerBI

Similar to Experiment 7, but using PowerBI to design an interactive dashboard for data visualization and exploration. PowerBI offers powerful features for creating interactive reports and dashboards.

## Experiment 9: Perform Web Mining Analysis

In this experiment, we perform web mining analysis to extract useful information from web data sources such as websites or social media platforms. We use techniques such as web scraping, text mining, and sentiment analysis to extract insights from web data.

Each experiment folder contains code, data files (if applicable), and documentation detailing the experiment's objectives, methodology, and results.
